// Explanation of the Code
// Class Definition:

// The car class contains attributes like name, type, price, year, and seats, along with two methods to display the car details.
// Display by Value:

// displayByValue(car c): Takes a car object as a parameter (by value). This means a copy of the object is made, and any changes to c inside this method wonâ€™t affect the original car object.
// Display by Reference:

// displayByReference(car &c): Takes a car object as a reference parameter (using &). This means any changes made to c inside this method will affect the original car object because no copy is made.
// Main Function:

// In main(), you create several car objects (c1, c2, c3, c4) and populate their attributes.
// Each car's details are displayed first by value and then by reference, showcasing the differences in how the data is handled.
