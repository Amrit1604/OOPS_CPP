In C++, a constructor is a special member function of a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created. The primary purpose of a constructor is to initialize the object's members.

Key Points About Constructors:
A constructor has the same name as the class.
It does not have a return type, not even void.
It can be overloaded, i.e., you can have multiple constructors with different parameters.
It can be default, parameterized, or copy constructors.

Types of Constructors:
Default Constructor: A constructor with no parameters.
Parameterized Constructor: A constructor with parameters to initialize the object with specific values.
Copy Constructor: A constructor that creates a copy of an existing object.
